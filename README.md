Development API test server
===========================

* npm install

* npm install -g node-mongo-seeds

* Run $ mongod (start mongodb server)

* Run $ seed to seed your mongodb with all your data from your /seeds folder.

**Note:** Every time you run $ seed it will blow away all the data in your collections and re-populate them with whatever is in your /seeds directory.
