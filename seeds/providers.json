    "description": "A good therapist can help you change. I have been in practice for over 40 years. If you want a therapist who is quiet or leans back in his chair saying, \"tell me more about this...\" or \"uh huh\", this is not me. Likewise, if you want a highly intellectual Jungian-type of analysis with multiple sessions analyzing ones dreams, I am not the right therapist for you. I am an active, involved therapist who gives advice and feedback. I will answer most questions. Therapy is a collaborative process. I make use of cognitive behavior therapy and other therapies. I am the youngest certified graduate in psychoanalysis in the history of post-graduate center for mental health. I know that endless talking about the past does not promote growth or change. Many people I see have had previous long term therapy, have excellent insight into their issues, yet are still depressed and stuck. People like this need a powerful psychological jump start to move them forward. Our work together will promote this movement. Therapy is not s forever process. You should feel and see change happening. I know I can help you and you will want to work with me.",
